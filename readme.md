<h1>Lumot</h1>
Lumot is a funny bot made for fun. It is basically "Dad Bot" with customization settings.

<h1>Setup</h1>
<h2>Package Installation</h2>
First, open CMD and execute this:

```pip install py-cord```

If it did not work, that means pip is not in your path. Try executing these commands:

```python -m pip install py-cord```
```py -m pip install py-cord```
```python3 -m pip install py-cord```

<h2>Setupping the bot</h2>
After that, prepare your environment and put your token to config.json. \nIf you are using a platform like replit without any subscriptions which has your project public, then put it in an .env file!
\nThen just run main.py, your bot is ready!

<h2>Customization</h2>
Reminder - You have to be the owner of the server to do this.\n
After setupping your bot, use /edit command to give your bot a name.\n
To make your staff members be able to edit the bot, use /addstaff command to add staff role names. Use /delstaff if you did something wrong.\n
Now, after setupping, just write something like "im good", and it will reply with your customized messages!\n
